Requirements:
* At least two pages (a home page and a shop page, which includes your shopping cart)

* Let the user navigate between the pages with a navigation bar, which will be shown on both pages.

* On the shopping cart page, you should have the same navigation bar that displays the number of items currently in the cart.

* You should also have a button next to it where you can go to the cart to checkout and pay

* Build individual card elements for each of your products. Display an input field on it, which lets a user manually type in how many items they want to buy. Also, add an increment and decrement button next to it for fine-tuning. You can also display a title for each product as well as an “Add To Cart” button.

* Once a user has submitted their order, the amount on the cart itself should adjust accordingly.

* Make sure to test your app thoroughly using the React Testing Library.
